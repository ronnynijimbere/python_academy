What is NumPy?

NumPy is a Python library that allows you to perform numerical calculations.

Think about linear algebra in school (or university) - NumPy is the Python library for it. It’s about matrices and vectors - and doing operations on top of them.

At the heart of NumPy is a basic data type, called NumPy array.

A NumPy array is a multi-dimensional matrix of numerical data values (integers or floats). A NumPy array can hold different types of data---but it focuses on numerical data values. For all other data types (e.g. strings), it's often better to use Pandas DataFrames.

NumPy specializes in providing efficient linear algebra operations.

Among those operations are maximum, minimum, average, standard deviation, variance, dot product, matrix product, and many more. NumPy implements these operations efficiently and in a rigorous consistent manner. By learning NumPy, you'll equip yourself with a powerful tool for data analysis on numerical multi-dimensional data.

What can NumPy do for you?

Fear of missing out on machine learning and data science? Learning NumPy now is a great first step into the field of machine learning and data science. In machine learning, crucial algorithms and data structures rely on matrix computations. What are matrices? In NumPy, they are nothing but arrays with homogeneous data of the same type - for example - float values.

Most machine learning experts agree that Python is the top programming language for machine learning.

Within Python, NumPy is one of the most important libraries for data science and machine learning. For instance, searching for the keyword ‘numpy machine learning’ reveals more than 3 million pages. If you instead search for 'scikit-learn machine learning', it'll give you fewer results---even though NumPy is not a machine learning library like scikit-learn!

No matter which library is more popular – NumPy is the 600-pound gorilla in the machine learning and data science space. If you are serious about your career as a data scientist, you have to conquer NumPy now!

But NumPy is not only important for machine learning and data science. Other areas rely on NumPy, too. People use NumPy in maths, electrical engineering, high-performance computing, simulations, and many more areas.

If you need to visualize data, you very much rely on the NumPy library, too. Python's plotting library matplotlib needs NumPy like you need air to breathe.

What are the limitations of NumPy?

The focus of NumPy is working with numerical data. It's both: powerful and low-level (it provides basic functionality for high-level algorithms).

If you enter the machine learning and data science space, you want to master NumPy first. But eventually, you will use other libraries that operate on a higher level such as Tensorflow and scikit-learn. Those libraries contain out-of-the-box machine learning functions such as training and inference algorithms. Have a look at them after reading this tutorial.

If you enter mathematical areas that are not close to linear algebra, you may want to shift your focus to other libraries that better suit your needs. Examples are matplotlib and pyqtgraph.

In any case, NumPy will help you understand more advanced libraries.
